# aksim

`aksim` is a program for calculating pull probability distributions over series of banners in the game Arknights. You can find more information about the algorithms used in [this article](https://kylechen.net/writing/gacha-probability/).

## Developer notes

This project uses [`divan`](https://crates.io/crates/divan) for benchmarking calculation methods. You can run benchmarks with the standard [`cargo bench`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-bench.html) command.
